# arduino_drone
drone driven by atmega328 and controlled by radio modules

We (my brother and i) started with searching for an already built drone online.
We found this one: https://www.instructables.com/id/Arduino-Drone-Quadcopter-3D-Printed/
Most of our parts are from his list.

Parts used:

    1x Battery: https://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopters-parts/pp_171923.html?wid=21&lkid=10647457
      (i suggest to buy 2 of them to be able to exchange them and increase flight time)
    1x Charger: https://www.gearbest.com/rc-parts/pp_27705.html?wid=21&lkid=10647469
      (you'll have to buy a power adapter if you don't have one)
    4x Motors: https://www.gearbest.com/rc-quadcopter-parts/pp_543284.html?wid=21&lkid=10647441
    4x ESC's: https://www.gearbest.com/multi-rotor-parts/pp_243404.html?wid=21&lkid=10647455
    1x Propellers: https://www.gearbest.com/rc-parts/pp_109432.html?wid=21&lkid=10647475
      (it is important to buy 2x clockwise and 2x anticlockwise, i suggest to buy 2 times cause they break easily)
    Frame: Most of it is 3D printed, but you'll need an aluminium square tube too
    2x Radio Module: https://www.gearbest.com/transmitters-receivers-module/pp_440447.html?wid=21&lkid=10647491

    1x Gyroscope: https://www.gearbest.com/development-boards/pp_22530.html?wid=21
    2x Joystick

  Some smaller parts:
  
    resistor: 2x 120Ohm 2x 4,7 kOhm
    2x 3.3V voltage stabilizer
    8x female - male, 6x male - male goldpins
    2x LED diode
    cable 
    2x Atmega: Don't forget the bootloader
    2x Quarz 16MHz
    capacitors: 4x 22pF
                2x 10uF
                2x


You can find the CAD files of our parts in this repository. Use Autodesk Inventor 2019 to open them.
You'll need a 3D printer: We were allowed to use one of the "EULE - Gm√ºnder Wissenswerkstatt": Thanks for it!
